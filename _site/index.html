<p>I had the pleasure of working with <a href="https://natasha-pankina.com">Natasha Pankina Illustrations</a> for a month to build her own online illustrations store.  With tens of thousands of stock vectors, she needed a way to house, encode, format, watermark, fingerprint, and merchandise her works of art. The result is a highly customized Wordpress e-commerce store.  She has an easy to use upload her vectors. The site automatically processes the EXIF data as does Shutterstock to set all the store variables, categories, and licenses.  The system ingests the content, autocreates all the online resources, and license formats, and certain product queues allow for seasonal banner ads to automatically rotate in for merchandising. On the backend, is Glusterfs mounted on to a Docker Swarm, ready to scale, as demand requires.  What are you waiting for? Buy something!</p>

    <p>With <a href="https://github.com/pleasemarkdarkly/bootstrap">dotfiles</a> being all the rage, I thought I would shove together my config. While it’s far from complete, what I did that I wish others would do, is break up the various program installs into files, i.e. apt, brew, npm, git, gem, are seperated into .list files. I can easily update them with either my latest list or tweak them. It seems that while lots of people have pretty interesting setups, its effort to try some else’s dotfiles then update them with our own twist. That said, I also include a Dockerfile which I used to test the installation process and for others to watch the install before trying it out on their machine. This setup fetches some config files from my servers, so you will want to read all the wgets and make sure you are comfortable with what my script is doing. As always, don’t trust my scripts, read them for yourself!</p>

        WSDOT Collision Predictions
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Jul 2019</span>

    <div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/accidents.png" alt="accident modeling" style="width: 500px;" /></div>

<p>To better understand accidents in the Northwest, I processed the WSDOT’s data on serious to fatal accidents. Specifically, I processed the WSDOT reported collisions and mapped them to the nearest intersections, ranked, color-coded our 500 top dangerous intersections and displayed them on a heatmap by the frequency of accidents by date and time.</p>

<p>I requested WSDOT to provide Northwest collisions between 2015 through June 2018 which I parsed grouping by city and date, then used Alteryx to forecast by week accidents after which I use Python to weight each day afterwhich I feed into Tableau for visualization. The result is a map of our area that uses the current day to present locations which have been historically and forecasted to be probable for collisions.</p>

<p>The code and dataset may be accessed <a href="https://github.com/pleasemarkdarkly/wsdot_visualization">here</a>. The code consists of three scripts. The first one, “wsdot_parser.py”, will open the WSDOT dataset. Please note that the code assumes that the dataset will be on the same folder level and named “king.csv”. This script will generate two derived datasets: “weekday_coeffs.csv” and “weekly_table.csv”.</p>

<p>The first is a table where the general probability of an accident per city and weekday (Monday-Sunday) is represented by a number (0 to 1). The second one is the aggregate accidents per week over the full dataset grouped by city. Each row represents a week and it just counts the number of accidents that happened on that week at that city.</p>

<p>To do the actual forecast Alteryx Designed is required. The script provided (“arima_iter.yxmc”) will produce a forecast of accidents for the selected city (you must manually choose it in the Alteryx interface). This forecast is per week and each row represents a week for that city and is the result of an ARIMA model fit to the whole dataset per city and week.</p>

<p>Once all the cities have a forecast then the Python script “merger.py” will produce the final forecast for the next 16 weeks starting on the last date found on the WSDOT dataset. The general forecast for a week is spread between the days of that week, weighting each day by the weekday coefficient previously computed. At the end, the file “full_forecast.csv” is produced as the final output. This file can feed Tableau to create a visualization.</p>
