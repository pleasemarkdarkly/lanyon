    <p><a href="https://github.com/markedphillips/docker_mac_apt">MacOSX forensic analysis framework containerized.</a></p>

<p>mac_apt is a python based framework, which has plugins to process individual artifacts (such as Safari internet history, Network interfaces, Recently used files, Spotlight typed searches..) The framework does the heavy lifting, parsing of disk/volume image and offers a unified output interface, which currently supports writing out data as CSV, Sqlite and Excel formats. There is an API which plugins can use to access files and folders within the disk image. Currently DD and E01 images are supported. DMG files without compression work too. You can use a mounted image too (with limited support on windows for this feature). We even put in a native HFS parser adding support for lzvn/lzfse compressed files.</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/pleasemarkdarkly/speech-to-text-batch">For the Record Court Audio to ML transcripts</a></p>

<p>A lawyer asked me if I knew a simple way to convert a large volume of Court testimony to transcripts without having to order the entire testimony’s transcription. As I couldn’t find anyting cheaper than $1/minute, I turned to Amazon and Google APIs for audio to text transcription. The cost was something like .006 to .009 every 15 seconds and that’s after the $300 a year gift. The above repo is a collection of BASH scripts and Python which chunk up the audio and send them off for transcripting. I hope no one has to use this, but it works really well.</p>

    <span class="post-date">01 Jan 2006</span>

    <p>With the vision of creating an in-store and at home experience for content distribution. Greenplay was an end-to-end system with content licensing; all North American music and Warner Brothers/Paramount video content, merchandising in-store DVD/HD-DVD/Bluray product sales, music downloads, and at home streaming content on Greenplay set top boxes. The below in-store PODs and at home players were developed.</p>

<p>A self-enclosed, flat-panel device for retailers to offer in-store sampling, purchasing and fulfillment of digital music and movies.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/greenplay.png" alt="Greenplay" style="width: 700px;" /></div>

<p>Studio approved video content purchsae and rental through SD cards and PC peripherals, including $99 video player.</p>

<p>In 2000, after the wide spread adoption of Napster and RIAA Lawsuits against the Rio mp3 player, large scale mp3 downloads were destroying the retail businesses behind traditional music distribution.  One such company Transworld Entertainment licensed our software and hardware to better engage with custoemrs. The listening and viewing station was born and this system was the largest system of its kind, due to cost, ease of installation, and impact to “retail lift.”</p>

<p>In 2005, A DOT was hired by Starbucks to develop the Hear Music in-store music system.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/lvs.png" alt="LVS" style="width: 700px;" /></div>

<p>In-store listening and viewing station that uses Windows Media technology to store and stream content; lets shoppers scan and preview any CD or DVD in retailer’s catalog and enables use cross merchandising, loyalty programs, point-of-sale integration, and chain-wide “try and buy”programs. Deployed in more than 600 stores and 13,000 stations (as of 2010).</p>

<p>When Amazon opened up their online store API, as a joke we created this website that would track peer to peer loans and remind parties when the loan was due or the item needed to be returned. During the expiration period, the system would remind the parties, as well as provide options for each party to replace the item or gift the item using Amazon Web Services. While the idea was cute, no one used the services. We blame marketing.</p>
